<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


Building a good Discord bot for all of your needs using C# and .NET can be confusing with the lack of tutorials, unhelpful documentation, and scarcity of 
resources in general. After spending quite some time researching different libraries and ways to accomplish this, I finally found a tutorial series by
Coding with Efehan. But with the recent release of .NET 6 and changes to the libraries, I felt that a more concise codebase was needed.

This project was made to showcase how you can easily build a Discord bot in .NET 6, the different things you can do with the bot, and foster a growing
and supportive community around Discord bot development in .NET. I hope you find this project helpful!
